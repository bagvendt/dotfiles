This is my way of finally structuring my dotfiles, starting with my .vimrc file and favorite vim plugins.
This project is intended for personal use, hence most configs/scripts will only work under Ubuntu.

Thanks:

github.com/scrooloose - nerdtree
github.com/msanders - snipmate, colorsceme slate, and most of the settings from .vimrc
